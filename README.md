I completed a portfolio project where I curated a collection of my best work samples to showcase my skills in graphic design. The project included a variety of design projects I've worked on, such as branding materials, website designs, and digital illustrations. I also included descriptions for each project, highlighting my creative process and the tools I used. Additionally, I mentioned the company where I completed an internship, providing context for my professional experience.
